At the time, leprosy was strongly stigmatized and infected people were often sent to leproseries to die there. Despite the lack of knowledge about the potential treatments of Western medicine, traditional Indian medicine had a treatment in the form of chaulmoogra tree oil.", "The problem was that this chaulmoogra oil was difficult to apply topically and could not be injected due to its viscous and thick texture. At the age of 23, Alice Ball developed an ingenious method of saponifying the oil, i.e. converting it into soap, and creating chaulmoogra acid, which could then be combined with a liquid and injected.", "Since the healing properties of oil can now be applied directly into the body, leprosy was treated more effectively. Unfortunately, all this happened shortly before her death in 1916, at the age of 24.

This is evidenced by the destinations of fragile marine ecosystems, such as Hawaii and Thailand, which prohibit or limit the use of products containing certain ingredients.", "When you are looking for a safe sunscreen for reefs, you should therefore look at products that do not contain the following elements:", "Sunscreens containing small minerals called nanoparticles - usually used in spray products - can also be toxic. It is therefore preferable to opt for \"micro\" or \"non nano\" mineral sunscreens. Products containing exfoliating balls should also be avoided, as they contain microplastics that can be released into the ocean.", "Instead, look for mineral products whose active ingredients are non-nanometric zinc oxide or non-nanometric titanium dioxide, which are considered to be less harmful to marine fauna and flora.

And I would not feel comfortable with it. The other reason is that I think that sex workers have a very free mind. They have a more independent mind and want to decide when they work. They also want to decide where they are going. If they want to say that business is better in another country, they leave and work there.

They are to help to integrate the ageing population into the social life.", "And for the project that the Foundation \"Landleben\" has launched, the kiosks were actually newly built, partly with funding, partly with support from the Foundation. Here, tele-consultation hours with specialists are also supposed to be possible. In fact, the building first exists - and it has to be filled with life more and more, which in part also depends on what money and staff can be found for.", "Health kiosks are intended to offer a low-threshold range of health-related advice and to help fewer people need to be treated in medical practices or hospitals. Patients can have simple treatments there, such as blood pressure measurements and association changes. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) plans 1,000 health kiosks throughout Germany by the end of 2023. According to this plan, municipalities should establish health kiosks in districts that are characterised by poverty and finance them together with the health insurance funds.According to the key points of Lauterbach's legislative initiative, the public sector should bear 20 percent of the expenditure, while the statutory health insurance funds should be obliged to take over 74.5 percent and private health insurances 5.5 percent.The health kiosk in Hamburg-Billstedt was launched in 2017 as a model project. Its financing was announced in the first quarter of 2023 after the withdrawal of the technicians health insurance fund, DAK health and the barmer in the meantime uncertain. Now, according to AOK, a solid financial basis is secured. In the Hamburg district of Lurup, a further health kiosk is to be opened in the first quarter 2023.", "Lauterbach had a somewhat different idea in mind when he spoke of his planned 1000 kiosks. The pilot project in the Billstedt district of Hamburg visited the SPD minister in the summer and was impressed. From his point of view, it is future-oriented for the German health care system. Here, appointments for specialists are arranged, there are addiction counselling or consultation hours for mental health - everything as unbureaucratic as possible and, above all, often multilingual. Because in Billstedt, the proportion of foreigners is about 27 percent above average. One in five of the approximately 70,000 people in Billstedt get Hartz IV, which makes the district one of the poorest in Hamburg.", "Specialists prefer other locations, there is a shortage and the existing doctors are even more burdened. This should at least partially cushion the health kiosk. The basic idea is: Who perceives the offers here becomes less sick, needs less treatment and also does not have to go to the hospital so often. \"In Germany, neither the purse nor the place of residence can decide on the treatment of patients\", said the minister when visiting the kiosk in August. Health kiosks can make a difference, especially in structurally weak areas. The SPD politician wants to reach those who do not have regular access to doctors: \"Those who are usually only reached when it is too late.\"", "However, the plan is resisted, especially since it is not clear who is paying for the facility. According to a reply to a small request from the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, the ministry plans that 74.5 percent of the budget of the kiosks should come from the statutory health insurance companies. 20 percent should pay the municipalities. However, the technicians health insurance, the DAK and the Barmer have now withdrawn from the model experiment in Hamburg. They fear the emergence of expensive double structures. And that scarce medical personnel will then be missing in hospitals or practices. Moreover, the cash registers do not want to pay for offers that only have to do with health at a distance.", "Others suspect a warning signal for the Federal Health Minister, because the cash registers are disturbed by the fact that they are supposed to pay the lion's share of the kiosk budgets.

For gas, this is twelve cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), for district heating 9.5 cents per kWh. The electricity price will be set at 40 cents per kWh. For the remaining consumption beyond the 80 percent limit, the beneficiaries will continue to pay the regular market price. The difference will be borne by the state.", "Consumers automatically benefit from the reliefs: For owners, the energy supplier calculates the reduced gas discount directly. Tenants are often not themselves customers. In this case, the landlord must pass on the relief within the scope of the operating costs settlement.

The incentive to save additional electricity and gas is maintained, as only one share of the previous consumption is subsidized. For every kWh that goes beyond that, the market price must be paid. In addition, if households consume less than the forecast has predicted, they will receive additional money back at the end of the year as part of the billing - the saved amount multiplied by the higher contract price.", "For example, if the above-mentioned family saves 20 percent of the gas, it will get 660 euros again.

If someone changes the supplier in the course of 2023, he may only pass on the relief if the consumer has submitted a invoice copy of the original supplier to the new supplier.", "The Federal Government still has no answer to this. The method of using historical consumption as the basis for calculating price brakes has weaknesses, according to the consumer centres. Because if the energy consumption of a household has recently fallen sharply, because someone has moved out, this receives comparatively high aid. However, if a relative lives in the house permanently around, the consumption and thus also the necessary relief for the costs should have increased.", "The model could also penalise consumers, who have already dealt with energy very sparingly this year. \"They will then have more difficulties in consuming only 80 percent of the previous energy, and will have to pay the expected high market prices for the remaining consumption,\" the consumer protectors said.
