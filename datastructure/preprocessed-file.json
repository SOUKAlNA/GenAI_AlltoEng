He is the CEO of Veolia Water Technologies, a subsidiary of the Veolia group specializing in water treatment, whose turnover is 1.65 billion euros and which is based in France.", "In the run-up to the European elections, while climate change and its effects are a major issue, water is a key issue for politicians and leaders.", "But it is also a crucial issue for voters, and according to a recent survey by the European Commission, pollution is the main concern of Europeans, with 69% of them expressing concern about the effects of pollution on water safety.", "As Europe is increasingly concerned about water pollution, it is also becoming increasingly rare, yet demand has never been so high, and it is estimated that it will double by 2030.", "The water present in Europe comes from both the continent, with rivers and lakes, but also from rains, the outside, and it is essential to ensure the cleanliness of these two sources.", "It is essential for the hydrological cycle, biodiversity, food and economy, water is simply vital.\"There is no alternative,\" says Ovink.", "Jeremy Wilks asked the panel about the state of the continent's rivers, confirming citizens' concerns about them.", "Compared to the global context, European water would be relatively healthy, Mr Ovink said, but there are still many questions.", "\"We should be concerned about it,\" he says. \"Water affects our health, our human health, our children's health, if we want to raise them in a healthy environment, but it also affects the health of our food systems, combined with industrialization, pollution and chemicals in our waters.\"", "Among the disturbing substances found in our rivers are the so-called \"eternal\" chemical pollutants, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS. There are also traces of antibiotics, hormones, industrial chemicals, cyanotoxins, nanomaterials and many other substances.", "\"What we find in our water is what comes from our environment,\" says Mr Valleteau de Moulliac. \"If it is not surprising that the by-products of European industries are found in our water, it is possible to monitor this influx and treat water if necessary.", "According to Mr Fink-Hooijer, this work has been supported by international legislation, which has already been the case with the Drinking Water Directive.", "\"We have ensured that PFAS should be phased out by 2026, or sorted and monitored, and we are now giving advice on how to proceed,\" she says. \"Proposals are also pending a vote to combat the presence of pollutants in surface and groundwater waters.", "\"That is why it is interesting to regulate and ensure that Member States agree on the need for such a measure,\" explains Ms Fink-Hooijer, who stresses that broad acceptance will speed up any water monitoring and treatment process.", "Denmark, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Norway have asked the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to ban PFAS altogether. PFAS has proliferated because of their use in industries such as aeronautics and medicine. However, it can take thousands of years to decompose and continue to pollute, even away from their source.", "Another question was asked by Charline Albericicci, director of the Fluctuations Festival, a floating transnational festival that travels along European rivers and aims to encourage people to take an interest in social, environmental and citizenship issues.", "She asked the panel whether, in order to preserve water and achieve the EU's climate goals by 2030, our rivers, seas and oceans should have a specific legal status.", "\"There are countries in the world that not only plan to do so, but actually do it, like the Dominican Republic,\" says Ovink.", "In Europe, things are a little less simple, because every country in the Union has a slightly different approach to water, but there is hope, and regulations are already in place.", "\"We already have very strong access to the provisions, such as the directive on environmental crime [which supports the protection of the environment through criminal law], which is very strong,\" says Fink-Hooijer.", "\"In France, there is a trail, which is the possibility for classes within schools to adopt a river, which seems to me to be a very good idea because you claim the ownership and responsibility of a particular watercourse,\" she adds. \"Giving children this opportunity helps them understand the importance of protecting our rivers.\"", "According to Mrs Ovink, this is a small step towards a broader national awareness of the problems involved.", "\"It creates a sense of ownership and the ability to do something. A legal status really gives you the opportunity to say \"stop\". I will do everything in my power to get there. I think it's very effective.\"", "Agriculture is one of the most water-intensive sectors. About 70% of the available water is used for agriculture to produce food on our plates. If water for agriculture is polluted, it has a direct impact on everyone. However, agricultural pollution must also be addressed.", "Policies to support farmers who adopt more sustainable methods to reduce pollutants released to water should be given priority, says Ovink, in response to a question from Jerry Mac Evilly, the Friends of the Earth policy manager in Ireland.", "Mr Ovink, who comes from an agricultural sector, notes, however, that there is no point in pointing the finger at individual farmers. \"It is not the farmer who has to blame, about the pollutants that are found in our environment, it is the system that surrounds it and that we have to change\".", "Valleteau de Moulliac adds that we must not forget that agricultural waste water products have real value. \"We can create energy from pollution,\" he explains, stressing that food industry waste can be used to produce fertilizers.", "While there are many questions related to pollution and water scarcity, the questions about solutions are all the same.The panel was asked what would motivate a city to change its infrastructure, in order to manage situations such as sewage-related floods in watercourses, as this may have happened in cities such as Brussels, during heavy rains.", "Urban solutions may include infrastructure expansion, but also more innovative ideas such as roof vegetation and concrete or asphalt replacement, which \"are much cheaper than any other option, and also have positive side effects on the well-being of citizens, including mental health,\" says Fink-Hooijer.", "The solutions must also be flexible depending on the extent of the problem, and she explained how the 1991 Urban Water Treatment Directive had evolved.", "Originally, it was limited to large agglomerations, which allowed smaller cities to discharge their wastewater. \"They were below the threshold required to have urban waste water treatment facilities. The system was then modified to include more polluters, focusing on the one that generated pollution at the source.", "Beyond cities, there are also solutions that take into account the entire hydrological cycle. This is how blue water, green water and grey water (waste water) interact to create the global water system on which we depend. To ensure the longevity of a hydrological cycle that benefits people, \"we need to create scalable natural solutions for rivers and urban landscapes,\" explains Fink-Hooijer.", "Valleteau de Moulliac gives an example of a park built in Alicante to absorb rainwater. However, this park was huge, and J. Wilks points out the potential problem of using natural solutions that are so dependent on space. \"There is enough space,\" says Valleteau de Moulliac.", "\"We must consider water as a local subject. There is a global impact, but it is a local subject,\" he adds.", "As Mr Valleteau de Moulliac points out, the improvement of the water system requires a vision as wide and complex as the hydrological cycle itself.If water adapts to any container, the same applies to our solutions.", "To learn more about the EU Water Framework Directive, it is here."], ["This organisation specialised in the field of prevention and responses to famines and other forms of food security drew the alarm at the beginning of the week in a report available on its website", "Even though all the signs are there, the American organization cannot be categorical, however, because it cannot access as it sees fit within the Gaza Strip.", "This report is in line with that of the World Food Programme (WFP), which made the same observation last April.", "According to his criteria, there is famine when 20% of the population is hungry, at least 30% of children suffer from weight loss and two adults or four out of 10,000 children die every day from hunger and its complications.", "The problem today for the FEWS organization is to be able to confirm the number of deaths actually due to famine.", "Israel has repeatedly denied that there is a famine in Gaza and rejected allegations that it used hunger as a weapon in its war against Hamas.", "If this fact were proven, it could be used as evidence of genocide before the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.", "The report also cautions against insufficient efforts to increase aid to Gaza and urges the Israeli Government to act urgently.", "A large part of Gaza's 2 million inhabitants have been displaced since the beginning of the war last October, and the Ministry of Health claims that 36,284 Palestinians have been killed to date.", "While most of the inhabitants are now concentrated in the south near Rafah, some have returned a little further north to Khan Yunes, where basic infrastructure is lacking and where the inhabitants struggle to obtain the minimum water necessary for their survival.", "This critical situation is not expected to improve much before the summer, in fact, despite the pressure exerted by the United States both on Benjamin Netanyahu's government and Hamas' allies to accept the last three-phase ceasefire proposal, negotiations are going on.", "And so as not to fix anything, this Wednesday, the Israeli Prime Minister said that in addition to the Gaza Strip, Israel is \"prepared for a very intense action in northern Israel\", on the Lebanese border, this time against Hezbollah.", "\"He who thinks he can hurt us and that we're going to stay hands joined has made a major mistake,\" he added."], ["The 111th edition of the Tour de France started this Saturday from Florence in Italy under a sun of lead.
